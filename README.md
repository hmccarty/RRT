# RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees)
RRT is an algorithm widely used in robotics for path planning. It takes a map of an unexplored location, then plots paths of exploration. 

This can then be used in combination with algorithms like A(star) to plan out paths from one point to another.

Here is an example of where my test is at right now:

There is still a lot of work to be done for this to be functional or useful.
