# RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree)
RRT is an algorithm widely used in robotics for path planning. It takes a map of an unexplored location, then continuously builds a space-filling tree. 

This can then be used in combination with algorithms like A* to plan out paths from your origin to a designated goal.

Here is an example of what my visualization looks like at the moment:

Obviously this can be made much better, but staring at random lines isn't as fun as it seems.
